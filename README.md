# _Hiking Log_

#### _Beyond these words lie your instructions which will guide you narrowly on a path to application execution, if you so choose to follow. Add a Hike, Quest, or a distance of Mother Earth you have overcome or rose to the top of, in this life or another._ _Jan-2018_

## Narrative

_We all have paths we take in life. Some more challenging than others. Some for leisure, some for need, and others out of circumstance, and it is our position in this life to overcome and conquer whatever path presents itself. Here I wish to account for the beauty you have witnessed, with your own eyes and had cross your path, created by mother nature so naturally and unimpeded._
